I'm visiting Rome next month. What are some must-try restaurants? I'm looking for authentic local food, not tourist traps.

That's a fantastic trip! Rome has an incredible food scene. To avoid tourist traps, you generally want to find places that are a bit off the main squares, have a simple menu (often only in Italian), and are filled with locals.

Here are a few highly-regarded spots known for authentic Roman cuisine:

#### For Classic Roman Pasta

- **Roscioli Salumeria con Cucina:** Near Campo de' Fiori. It's a deli, a wine shop, and a restaurant. It's famous for its Carbonara and Amatriciana. It's very popular, so you absolutely must book in advance.
- **Da Enzo al 29:** Located in the charming Trastevere neighborhood. It's a small, classic trattoria with amazing Cacio e Pepe. They don't take reservations, so be prepared to queue.
- **Felice a Testaccio:** In the Testaccio district, a real foodie neighborhood. They are famous for their creamy Cacio e Pepe which they mix at your table. Reservations are essential.

#### For Pizza

- **Pizzarium Bonci:** Near the Vatican. This isn't a sit-down restaurant, but a world-famous _pizza al taglio_ (pizza by the slice) spot. The toppings are incredibly creative and high-quality. A must-visit for lunch.
- **Da Remo:** Another classic in Testaccio for thin, crispy, Roman-style round pizza. It's a no-frills, bustling pizzeria.

#### A General Tip

Look for a "Trattoria" or "Osteria" rather than a "Ristorante" for a more traditional, family-run experience. And don't be afraid to wander down a side street in neighborhoods like Trastevere, Monti, or Testaccioâ€”you'll often find the best food there.

What is the difference between an osteria and a trattoria?

That's a great question, as the lines have blurred over the years. Traditionally, the hierarchy was:

1.  **Osteria:** Originally, these were very simple places where you could bring your own food and just buy wine. Over time, they started serving simple, local dishes. The focus was on wine and a very limited, rustic menu.
2.  **Trattoria:** A step up from an osteria. A trattoria is typically a family-owned, casual restaurant serving traditional, regional recipes. The menu is not extensive, but the food is hearty and reasonably priced.
3.  **Ristorante:** This is the term for a full-service restaurant. It's more formal than a trattoria or osteria, with a wider menu, a wine list, a specific chef (not just 'mamma's cooking'), and professional service.

In modern Italy, especially in big cities like Rome, the terms are often used interchangeably for marketing. You can find very high-end osterias and very casual ristorantes. However, as a rule of thumb, choosing a place that calls itself a "trattoria" or "osteria" will still generally lead you to a more informal and traditional dining experience.
