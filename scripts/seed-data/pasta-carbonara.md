What's a good recipe for Pasta Carbonara? I want the authentic Italian one.

Of course! Here is a traditional recipe for authentic Italian Pasta Carbonara, which importantly, does **not** use cream. The creaminess comes from the egg yolks and pasta water.

#### Ingredients

- 200g Spaghetti
- 100g Guanciale (cured pork cheek is essential for authenticity)
- 2 large, very fresh egg yolks
- 30g Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated, plus more for serving
- Coarsely ground black pepper

#### Instructions

1.  **Cook the pasta:** Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti according to package directions until _al dente_.
2.  **Cook the guanciale:** While the pasta is cooking, slice the guanciale into small strips or cubes. Fry it in a non-stick pan over medium heat until the fat has rendered and the meat is crispy and golden. Do not add oil. Once done, remove the guanciale pieces with a slotted spoon, leaving the rendered fat in the pan.
3.  **Prepare the egg mixture:** In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the grated Pecorino cheese and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper to form a thick paste.
4.  **Combine:** Once the pasta is ready, drain it, reserving about a cup of the starchy pasta water. Immediately add the hot pasta to the pan with the rendered guanciale fat and toss well over low heat for about 30 seconds to coat the pasta.
5.  **Finish (Off the heat):** This is the most critical step. **Remove the pan from the heat**. Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, stirring quickly and vigorously. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs just enough to create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a tablespoon or two of the reserved pasta water until it reaches the desired consistency.
6.  **Serve:** Mix in the crispy guanciale pieces, serve immediately, and top with more Pecorino and black pepper.

_Buon appetito!_

My sauce always scrambles! How do I prevent that?

That is the most common pitfall! The key is to **take the pan off the heat before adding the egg mixture**.

The pasta and the rendered fat will be hot enough to cook the egg yolk into a creamy sauce without scrambling it. If the pan is still over a direct flame or a hot burner, the temperature will be too high, and the eggs will cook too quickly, turning into clumps.

So, to reiterate the crucial step: Pasta in pan -> toss with fat -> **pan off the stove** -> add egg mixture and stir like crazy. Adding the reserved pasta water also helps to temper the eggs and control the consistency. Good luck!
