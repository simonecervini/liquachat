Can you explain TypeScript generics with a simple example?

Of course. Generics are like variables for types. They allow you to write reusable code that can work over a variety of types rather than a single one.

Think of a function that returns the first element of an array. Without generics, you might have to write it for a specific type:

```ts
function getFirstElement(arr: number[]): number {
  return arr[0];
}
```

This only works for arrays of numbers. What if you have an array of strings? Or objects?

With generics, you can create a function that works for **any** type of array:

```ts
function getFirstElement<T>(arr: T[]): T {
  return arr[0];
}
```

Here, `T` is a generic type parameter. It's a placeholder for the actual type that will be provided when the function is called.

You can then use it like this:

```ts
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const firstNumber = getFirstElement(numbers); // TypeScript infers T is number

const strings = ["a", "b", "c"];
const firstString = getFirstElement(strings); // TypeScript infers T is string
```

This makes your code much more flexible and reusable while maintaining full type safety.

What does the `T` mean? Can I use another letter?

Yes, absolutely! The `T` is just a convention, standing for "Type". You can use any valid identifier. `T`, `U`, and `K` are common conventions for generic type variables, but you could use more descriptive names.

For example, this is functionally identical:

```ts
function getFirstElement<ElementType>(arr: ElementType[]): ElementType {
  return arr[0];
}
```

Using descriptive names like `ElementType` can sometimes make your code easier to understand, especially when dealing with multiple generic parameters.
