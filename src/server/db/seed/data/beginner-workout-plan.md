I want to start working out, but I'm a complete beginner. Can you suggest a simple weekly plan? I have access to a gym.

That's a great decision! Starting out can feel overwhelming, but consistency is more important than intensity at the beginning. A full-body routine is perfect for beginners because it hits all major muscle groups and gives them plenty of time to recover.

Here is a simple and effective 3-day per week full-body workout plan.

#### **The Plan: 3 Days a Week (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri)**

Perform each workout once a week, with at least one day of rest in between.

**Workout A**

1.  **Squats:** 3 sets of 8-12 reps
2.  **Push-ups (or Knee Push-ups):** 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP)
3.  **Dumbbell Rows:** 3 sets of 8-12 reps per arm
4.  **Plank:** 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds

**Workout B**

1.  **Dumbbell Lunges:** 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg
2.  **Overhead Press (with dumbbells):** 3 sets of 8-12 reps
3.  **Lat Pulldowns (machine):** 3 sets of 8-12 reps
4.  **Leg Raises:** 3 sets of 12-15 reps

**Workout C**

1.  **Leg Press (machine):** 3 sets of 10-15 reps
2.  **Dumbbell Bench Press:** 3 sets of 8-12 reps
3.  **Seated Cable Rows:** 3 sets of 8-12 reps
4.  **Bicep Curls & Tricep Pushdowns (superset):** 3 sets of 10-15 reps

**Important Notes:**

- **Warm-up:** Before each workout, do 5-10 minutes of light cardio (like jogging or cycling) followed by some dynamic stretches.
- **Form over weight:** Focus on learning the correct form first. Watch videos and don't be afraid to ask for help. Start with light weights.
- **Progressive Overload:** Aim to gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets over time. This is how you get stronger.

How long should I rest between sets?

That's a crucial question. The amount of rest you take between sets influences your results.

For a beginner-focused, general strength and muscle-building plan like this one, a good rule of thumb is to rest for **60 to 90 seconds** between sets.

This provides enough time for your muscles to recover so you can perform the next set with good form, but it's not so long that you lose the metabolic stress that encourages growth.

- If a set felt very easy, you can aim for the shorter end, around 60 seconds.
- If a set was very challenging and you were close to failure, resting for the full 90 seconds is a good idea.

For exercises like the plank or leg raises, you might only need 30-45 seconds of rest. Listen to your body!
