I need some summer travel ideas for a 1-week trip in Europe. I like a mix of history, good food, and beautiful scenery. Not just a beach holiday.

That's a great combination! Europe offers many destinations that perfectly blend those three elements. Here are a few ideas across different regions:

#### 1. The Amalfi Coast, Italy

- **History:** Explore the ancient ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum, frozen in time by Mount Vesuvius.
- **Food:** Unbelievable. Fresh seafood, amazing pasta, lemons the size of your fist, and the birthplace of pizza is just a short trip away in Naples.
- **Scenery:** Absolutely breathtaking. Think cliffside villages like Positano and Ravello, with stunning views of the Mediterranean Sea. It's one of the most beautiful coastlines in the world.

#### 2. Lisbon & Sintra, Portugal

- **History:** Lisbon is rich with history, from the São Jorge Castle to the Belém Tower. A short train ride takes you to Sintra, which feels like a fairy tale with its whimsical palaces like Pena Palace.
- **Food:** Famous for its fresh seafood, Pastéis de Nata (custard tarts), and vibrant food markets like the Time Out Market.
- **Scenery:** Lisbon's seven hills offer amazing viewpoints (miradouros), and the coastline near Cascais is rugged and beautiful.

#### 3. Slovenia (Ljubljana & Lake Bled)

- **History:** Ljubljana, the capital, has a charming old town with a medieval castle overlooking the city.
- **Food:** A unique blend of Italian, Austrian, and Balkan influences. Hearty stews, great cheeses, and surprisingly good wine.
- **Scenery:** This is Slovenia's trump card. Lake Bled, with its island church and cliffside castle, is one of the most picturesque spots in Europe. The surrounding Julian Alps offer incredible hiking. It's a hidden gem.

Slovenia sounds interesting! Is it easy to get around without a car?

Yes, it's surprisingly easy, especially for the main highlights.

- **Ljubljana** is a very compact and walkable city. You won't need a car at all to explore the city center.
- **Ljubljana to Lake Bled:** There is a frequent and reliable bus service that connects the main bus station in Ljubljana directly to Lake Bled. The journey takes about an hour.
- **Around Lake Bled:** Once you're in Bled, you can walk around the entire lake, and there are buses to nearby attractions like Vintgar Gorge.

For that specific combination (Ljubljana and Lake Bled), a car is not necessary. A car would only become essential if you wanted to explore the more remote parts of the Julian Alps or the Soca Valley on a tighter schedule.
