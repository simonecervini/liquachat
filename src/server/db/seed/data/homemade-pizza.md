I want to make homemade pizza. Can you give me a simple but good dough recipe?

Absolutely! A great pizza starts with a great dough. Here is a simple, reliable recipe for a classic Neapolitan-style pizza dough that's easy to work with.

#### Ingredients (for 2-3 pizza bases)

- 500g "00" flour (or all-purpose flour if you can't find it)
- 300ml lukewarm water
- 1 tsp instant yeast
- 2 tsp fine sea salt
- 1 tbsp olive oil

#### Instructions

1.  **Activate Yeast:** In a small bowl, mix the lukewarm water and yeast. Let it sit for 5 minutes until it becomes foamy.
2.  **Mix Flour & Salt:** In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.
3.  **Combine:** Pour the yeast mixture and the olive oil into the flour. Mix with a spoon until a shaggy dough begins to form.
4.  **Knead:** Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead for about 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic.
5.  **First Rise:** Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.
6.  **Shape:** After the first rise, punch the dough down gently, divide it into 2 or 3 equal pieces, and shape each piece into a ball.
7.  **Second Rise (Optional but Recommended):** For the best flavor, place the dough balls in a sealed container and refrigerate for at least 24 hours, and up to 72 hours. This cold fermentation develops a much better taste. If you're short on time, you can just let them rest for another 30 minutes at room temperature before shaping.
8.  **Bake Hot:** When you're ready to bake, preheat your oven to its highest temperature (at least 250°C / 480°F) with a pizza stone or baking sheet inside. Stretch the dough, add your toppings, and bake for 7-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.

What is "00" flour and is it really necessary?

---

### assistant

"00" flour (or _doppio zero_) is a super-finely milled Italian flour. The "00" refers to the fineness of the grind, not the protein or gluten content.

**Is it necessary?** No, you can still make a delicious pizza with standard all-purpose flour.
**Does it make a difference?** Yes. Using "00" flour will give you a crust that is noticeably lighter, crispier, and has that classic "pull" you find in authentic Neapolitan pizzerias. The fine grind allows it to absorb water well and creates a very smooth, supple dough that's a pleasure to stretch.

If you're just starting out, all-purpose flour is perfectly fine. If you find you really enjoy making pizza, investing in a bag of "00" flour is one of the easiest ways to elevate your final product.
